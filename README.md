# shellshelf

`shellshelf` is a CLI for storing, searching, and sharing reusable shell commands.

The name is meant to evoke a shelf of reusable shell commands without borrowing software-library terminology.

## Highlights

- Store any command in an explicit shelf such as `curl`, `git`, `aws`, or `kubectl`
- Local storage lives under `~/.shellshelf/shelves/<shelf>.json`
- Shared storage stays team-based under `<repo>/teams/<team>/shelves/<shelf>.json`
- Use `-s` / `--shelf` to keep reads and writes scoped and tidy
- Fall back to a built-in `default` shelf when neither CLI nor config selects one
- Create shelves explicitly with `--create-shelf <name>`
- List available shelves with `--list-shelves`
- Search by extracted keywords instead of exact text only
- Use a shared team repository layout with optional GitHub-backed checkouts
- No shell-history import by design; commands are intentionally curated to avoid noise

## Quick Start

Install with Homebrew:

```bash
brew install vcali/tap/shellshelf
```

Add a command locally:

```bash
shellshelf -s curl -a "curl -I https://api.github.com/users/octocat"
```

Add a command with a short description:

```bash
shellshelf -s git -a "git log --oneline --graph -20" \
  --description "Compact recent history graph"
```

Search within a shelf:

```bash
shellshelf -s curl github octocat
shellshelf -s aws s3
```

List a shelf:

```bash
shellshelf -s curl -l
```

List available shelves:

```bash
shellshelf --list-shelves
shellshelf --repo /path/to/shared-shellshelf --team platform --list-shelves
shellshelf --repo /path/to/shared-shellshelf --all-teams --list-shelves
```

If `default_shelf` is configured, you can omit `-s` for normal reads and writes. If it is not configured, `shellshelf` falls back to the built-in `default` shelf.

Create a shelf explicitly:

```bash
shellshelf --create-shelf git
shellshelf --repo /path/to/shared-shellshelf --team platform --create-shelf aws
```

## Team Usage

Shared storage keeps ownership at the team level and organization at the shelf level:

```text
shared-shellshelf/
  teams/
    platform/
      shelves/
        curl.json
        aws.json
    payments/
      shelves/
        curl.json
```

Basic team-scoped usage:

```bash
shellshelf --repo /path/to/shared-shellshelf --team platform -s curl -a \
  "curl https://api.example.com/platform/health"

shellshelf --repo /path/to/shared-shellshelf --team platform -s curl -l
```

Cross-team search within one shelf:

```bash
shellshelf --repo /path/to/shared-shellshelf --all-teams -s curl stripe webhook
```

Default local-plus-team output is grouped by source:

```text
=== LOCAL / CURL ===

[1] Fetch Octocat profile
curl https://api.github.com/users/octocat

=== SHARED / PLATFORM / CURL ===

[1] Platform health check
curl -X POST https://api.example.com/platform/health \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

## Config

Minimal GitHub-backed config:

```json
{
  "default_shelf": "curl",
  "shared_repo": {
    "mode": "github",
    "github_repo": "acme/shared-shellshelf",
    "teams_dir": "teams",
    "default_team": "platform",
    "auto_update_repo": true,
    "auto_update_interval_minutes": 15
  },
  "default_list_limit": 20
}
```

GitHub-backed shared usage requires:

- `gh` installed and authenticated
- `git` available locally

## Releases

Create and push a semver tag to publish a GitHub Release automatically.

- Tags use the format `v<crate-version>` and must match `Cargo.toml`
- The Homebrew tap is `vcali/tap`
- Automatic tap updates require the `HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN` repository secret
- The GitHub release is created before the tap update so published formula URLs are live immediately
- Release assets currently include:
  - `shellshelf.rb` for tap publication and manual formula use
  - `shellshelf-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz`
  - `shellshelf-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
  - `shellshelf-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
  - matching `.sha256` checksum files

## Sensitive Data

`shellshelf` stores commands as provided. If a command contains live tokens, cookies, or other credentials, shared repository mode can expose them to teammates or commit history. Secret detection and redaction are still planned, not implemented.

## Development

Build:

```bash
cargo build
```

Run locally during development:

```bash
cargo run -- -s curl -l
```
